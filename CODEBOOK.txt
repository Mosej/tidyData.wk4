##CODE BOOK

This data set extracted and tidied from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0
The six variables are;

1.Subject:
this is the first column of the data set. which is an Id variable for the 30 participants in the
experiment. from the original explanation they are aged between 19-48 years

2.Activity:
this is a factor variable with six levels indicating what activites have been done by the partcipants
they are, 
"walking", 
"walking_upstairs",
"walking_downstairs",
"sitting",
"standing",
"laying".

3. signal:
this is a eight level factor variable which indicate signals extracted for each activity
the signals are:

fBodyAcc
fBodyAccJerk
fBodyGyro
tBodyAcc
tBodyAccJerk
tBodyGyro
tBodyGyroJerk
tGravityAcc

4. Axial

Each signal was measured in 3 axials ie XYZ for example

tBodyGyro-X
tBodyGyro-Y
tBodyGyro-Z

5. Mean.
averages of the signals, this is the average of means
over several trials, for each signal, for each activity and each individuals

6. std
this is the average of standard deviations over several trials, for each signal,
for each activity and each individuals
